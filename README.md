# o2tvseries-bot
Automate grabbing movies from o2tvseries.co

welcome to the script!

Notice that this is a beta version; expect a lot of errors(most of which you won't understand) and bugs.
But in the event that the script works, you might love it... I know I do *_^

# USAGE:
~~~~~~~
Remember that this script runs via cmd... Don't freak out!
You must ensure stable internet connection prior to running this script.
Please don't download single movies via this script, you will hate the quality... Believe me you will...
	... and I kinda forgot to program the movies section so expect failure if you do...
		... you have been warned!!!
Also, it will save the downloaded video in the folder from which its running.
Ensure that geckodriver.exe resides in the same location as the script, incase its not included.
To quit the script, type Ctrl+C

# FINAL WORDS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Enjoy the script....
